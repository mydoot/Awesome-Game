want a speed in ratio per frame but a speed ratio per second, like this:\ncameraX(t) - targetX = (cameraX(t - 1s) - targetX) * speed\n\nOk, but we still need to process each frame, we can use a exponent for this:\ncameraX(t) - targetX = (cameraX(t - timeDelta) - targetX) * speed^timeDelta\ncameraX(t) = targetX + (cameraX(t - timeDelta) - targetX) * exp(timeDelta * ln(speed))\n\npow is
